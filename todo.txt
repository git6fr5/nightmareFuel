Need to clean up:

equipables (attack input comes from where, ranged has alot of extra functionality etc)

collectibles (signal stuff and signal needs to not bob up and down with the rest)

spawners (signal stuff)

make demon and hellfire script
make hellfire's hellfire work like a particle

change equipables to be different in the sense that they are tied into the player (no need to collect them)

make cursor dependant on the equipped weapon
death animation
stun animation
damage (blood) particle effects

ooo damn howd you get the vocals on the noragami track :o

make initial circle smaller
make time vial more frequent
make spawner spawn clusters of 2/3/4 after specific times (can make it grow bigger also to indicate)
bloodsplatter effects
spawning noises (fire, ball, spawner laugh)
